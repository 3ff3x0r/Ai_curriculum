# 🧠 Full Math Study Plan (Halmos to Topology)

This is a complete, sprint-based roadmap from foundational math to advanced topics

## 📅 Timeline Overview (Sequential Phases)

| Phase | Topics | Main Resources | Estimated Duration |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1. Foundations | Set Theory (Halmos), Logic & Proofs (Velleman), Real Numbers (Spivak) | Halmos, Velleman, Spivak | 3–4 months |
| 2. Core Analysis + Algebra | Real Analysis I, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra I, ODE | Spivak/Rudin, Axler, Dummit & Foote, Zill | 4–5 months |
| 3. Structure & Continuity | Real Analysis II, PDEs, Abstract Algebra II, Galois Theory | Rudin, Strauss/Evans, D&F, Stewart | 4–5 months |
| 4. Transition | Graduate Linear Algebra, Metric Spaces, Differential Geometry | Roman, Rudin, Do Carmo/Pressley | 3–4 months |
| 5. Final Focus | General Topology | Munkres, Mendelson | 2–3 months (exam intensive) |

## 🔁 Sprint Rotation Example (Per Subject Block)

- Study ~1–1.5h per day, 6 days/week
- Rotate 2–3 core subjects per 6–8 week sprint
- Add review weeks between phases
